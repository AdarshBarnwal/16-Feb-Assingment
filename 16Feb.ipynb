    "Q1.\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "#database\n",
    "A database in SQL Server is made up of a collection of tables that stores a specific set of structured data.\n",
    "A table contains a collection of rows, also referred to as records or tuples, and columns, also referred \n",
    "to as attributes. Each column in the table is designed to store a certain type of information, for example,\n",
    "dates, names, amounts, and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    " SQL databases use a relational data model with structured data stored in tables,\n",
    "    while NoSQL databases store data in a flexible, non-tabular format.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases have a rigid schema and use SQL as the query language to retrieve and manipulate data,\n",
    " while NoSQL databases use various query languages and have a more flexible schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are known for strong consistency, \n",
    " while NoSQL databases prioritize scalability and performance over consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are typically used for complex queries and transactional systems,\n",
    " while NoSQL databases are commonly used for web and mobile applications, Big Data, and real-time analytics."
